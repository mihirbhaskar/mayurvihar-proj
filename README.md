# mayurvihar-proj

This series of do-files and scripts processes and cleans all raw data from the Mayur Vihar project, exporting final datasets at the individual and household level to be used for analysis.

All do-files should be run from the master do-file, 0_master, to ensure reproducibility.

The raw and output datasets are stored with encryption in a restricted-access Dropbox folder, protecting the personal information of individuals/beneficiaries in the community.  

While the 'final output' version of analysis is found in the mayurvihar-site repo and resulting website, this repo also contains some scripts featuring rough exploratory analysis.
